# Leetcode-LargestNumber
Implementation and description for Leetcode problem 179. Largest number

# Description
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 109

# How to run

Launch IntelliJ and click the dropdown menu in the top left of your screen. Click "Get From Version Control", make sure the version control dropdown says "Git" and paste the link to the repository. Click "Clone" and you should be set to run the program like you normally would on IntelliJ.
